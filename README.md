# CNC
  My CNC project in 2013, this project makes myself familiar with mechnical design and installation. All the parts are built and assemblied in Solidworks before order on the net. I bought a bench drill to assemble every raw material. Below are drawings before and after build. After build it up, the CNC can move according to input x, y, Z axis.
